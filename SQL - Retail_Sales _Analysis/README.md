# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis using SQL on a **single-table relational database**. The focus is on extracting insights, answering analytical questions, and practicing SQL concepts through well-structured queries.

All analysis is performed on one table, making the project simple, clear, and ideal for showcasing core SQL skills.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of table containing structured records related to the analysis domain. Each row represents an individual record, while columns store relevant attributes used for filtering, aggregation, and analysis.

## Objectives
- Understand and explore a table dataset
- Perform filtering and sorting using SQL
- Apply aggregate functions for analysis
- Use conditional logic to answer questions
- Write clean and efficient SQL queries

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Relational Database Management System (MySQL / PostgreSQL )

## Project Structure
```
p1.sql        -- Contains all SQL queries for analysis
README.md    -- Project documentation
```

## SQL Queries Included
The `p1.sql` file includes:
- Data exploration queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Conditional logic using CASE statements
- Analytical queries based on business logic

## How to Run the Project
1. Import the dataset into your SQL database
2. Open your SQL client or database tool
3. Execute the queries from `p1.sql`
4. Analyze the query results

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of SQL analysis
- Hands-on experience with aggregate functions
- Improved query-writing and logical thinking
- Ability to derive insights from structured data

## Future Enhancements
- Add more analytical queries
- Optimize queries for performance
- Extend the project to multiple tables
- Connect results to visualization tools
