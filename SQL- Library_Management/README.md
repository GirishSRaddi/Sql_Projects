# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is a structured SQL-based data analysis solution designed to extract meaningful insights from a relational dataset. It demonstrates practical SQL skills through well-organized queries focused on exploration, analysis, and reporting.

The project emphasizes clarity, accuracy, and professional query design suitable for academic, portfolio, or real-world analytical use cases.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of a structured table containing records relevant to the analysis domain. Each record represents a single entry with multiple attributes that support filtering, aggregation, and analytical evaluation.

The table is designed to support both descriptive and analytical SQL operations.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze structured data using SQL
- Perform data exploration and validation
- Apply filtering, sorting, and aggregation techniques
- Answer analytical and business-oriented questions
- Demonstrate clean and readable SQL query writing

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Database Management System (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)

## Project Structure
```
sql_Library_mgt.sql   -- Contains all SQL queries used in the project
README.md             -- Project documentation
```

## SQL Features Used
The SQL file includes queries utilizing:
- SELECT statements with filtering conditions
- Aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Conditional logic using CASE expressions
- Ordered result sets for better analysis

## How to Execute
1. Load the dataset into your SQL database
2. Open your preferred SQL client or database tool
3. Execute the queries from `sql_Library_mgt.sql`
4. Review the outputs to understand insights derived from the data

## Key Outcomes
- Clear understanding of dataset characteristics
- Practical experience with analytical SQL queries
- Improved data interpretation skills
- Strong foundation in SQL-based data analysis

## Possible Enhancements
- Add advanced analytical queries
- Optimize queries for performance
- Create views for reusable analysis
- Integrate query results with visualization tools

## Author
Developed as an independent SQL data analysis project.
